## Abstract 

### Wearables/ Biometric Project: 
Create an automated system of collecting biometric data from wearable fitness technology.
  #### Scope: 
  The process to approve a new drug for the public is extremely long and costly. With the emergence of wearable fitness technology, biometric data is being collected quite rapidly with decent accuracy. By automating a process of collecting data from wearable technology, it will be possible to collect data from clinical trial subjects and help with drug analysis. Long term, this may help speed up clinical trial time and cut costs due to ease of data collection.
